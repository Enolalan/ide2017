<h3>Proof of n</h3>
For any number n > 1, n= 3*p + 2*q = 2*(p+q) + p
<br />
Thus if n is even, as 2*(p+q) is even, we can let p equal to a even number. Then the sum of a even number and a even number is still even.
<br />
If n is odd, as 2*(p+q) is even, we can let p be a odd number. Then the sum of a even number and a odd number is odd.
